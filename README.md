# Python2_Guess_the_Number
# Randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the
user needs to be able to input information.) If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should
return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the
user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.
